# Amazon-Clone Project

## Description

The Amazon-clone project is a streamlined web application replicating the fundamental features of Amazon. Users can easily browse products, add them to a cart üõí, and seamlessly proceed to checkout. This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for me üíª, allowing me to enhance my skills in both front-end and back-end development.
